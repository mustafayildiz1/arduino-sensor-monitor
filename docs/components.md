# Components List

This project uses the following components:

- **Arduino Uno** (or compatible board)
- **LDR (photoresistor)**  
  - + one fixed resistor (e.g. 10 kΩ) to form a voltage divider
- **Temperature sensor**  
  - Example: LM35 or a similar analog temperature sensor
- **PIR motion sensor**  
  - 3 pins: VCC, GND, OUT
- **LED**  
  - + 220 Ω resistor in series
- **Breadboard & jumper wires**

## Notes

- The exact resistor values are not critical for this demo, as long as 
  the LDR and LED are wired safely and produce a readable signal.
- The project is meant as a learning exercise, not a production-ready system.
